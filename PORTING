This is a port of PetitParser-lr.190.mcz and PetitTests-lr.8.mcz
to the GNU Smalltalk System. This document holds the information
of how it was converted.

0.) basic gst-convert to translate from Squeak to GST
1.) Text does not exist, remove code related to it.
2.) asString -> asSymbol for all codes.
3.) maxVal -> largest
4.) Symbol>>value added for compability
5.) reversed -> reverse
6.) 0.7 as subtraction result
7.) Change ==> to => and >=> to ><
8.) PositionableStream needs changes. The PetitParser attempts
    to access variables directly, the names are different from
    Pharo to here.
